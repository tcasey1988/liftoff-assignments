## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This webapp will be used for creating and storing procedure documents that a business employee could generate. Creating procedures can often be time consuming and keeping track of them can be difficult when they're stored to different drives or different programs are used to create them. With this app, can employee can easily type up a procedure, attach images, and then save that procedure to a database. Users can then view a list of the saved procedures or search through the database to quickly find the information they're looking for.
### Features
Create and view procedures - Users will be presented with a form that they can fill out with relevant information. Once they are done the procedures will then be stored in a database. Users will then be able to view a list of links that will direct them to the stored procedures in the database.

Upload image - Users can upload and attach images to their documents to make them more users. Users should be able to click images to make them larger and zoom in on them to get a better view of anything that is unclear or hard to read.

Sharing - Users should be able to share procedures by exporting them to their PC, e-mailing the files as attach, or printing them out to physical copies.

Search - Users can fill out a search form that will search the database and present them with links to stored procedures that match their search term.

User login - After a user is logged in they will be able to view the procedures, as well as create new ones, and edit their own. Additionally, I would like an admin account has the same functionality but can also edit any procedure, delete procedures, and create new user accounts.

### Technologies
Java, IntelliJ, Spring, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, MAMP, Javascript

### What I'll Have to Learn
For this project I want to learn how to use Javascript to make improvements to the front end. In order to accomplish this I'll have to research Javascript frameworks and how to integrate Javascript with the technologies I already know how to use.
